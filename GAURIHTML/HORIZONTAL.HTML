If a user adds multiple spaces, the browser reduces them to a single space.
If a user adds multiple lines, the browser reduces them to a single line.
By default, the display of the Paragraph element is set to “block” which you can change using CSS. This means that if you add another paragraph to the webpage the next paragraph will be inserted in the next line on the webpage</p>
